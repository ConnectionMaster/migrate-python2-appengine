# Module 22 - Extending support for App Engine bundled services in Python 3

There are six folders in this directory that contain full applications using the Blobstore, Deferred, and Mail bundled services. A Python 2 version using the `webapp2` framework is provided along with a modernized Python 3 equivalent using the Flask web framework and the Python 3 App Engine SDK.

Bundled service | Python 2 `webapp2` | Python 3 Flask
--- | --- | ---
Blobstore | [code](blobstore2) | [code](blobstore3)
Deferred | [code](deferred2) | [code](deferred3)
Mail | [code](mail2) | [code](mail3)
