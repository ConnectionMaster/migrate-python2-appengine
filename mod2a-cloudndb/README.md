# Module 2 - Migrate from App Engine `ndb` to Cloud NDB

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 2 code to the [Module 2 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-cloudndb). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 1 repo folder](/mod1-flask) and leads developers through migrating away from App Engine's `ndb` to Cloud NDB to access Datastore, culminating in the code in this (`mod2a-cloudndb`) folder.
