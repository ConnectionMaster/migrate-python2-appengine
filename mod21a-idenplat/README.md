# Module 21 - Migrate from App Engine `users` to Cloud Identity Platform

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 2 code to the _forthcoming_ Module 21 codelab. The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 20 repo folder](/mod20-gaeusers) and leads developers through a migration to Cloud Identity Platform, culminating in the code in this (`mod21a-idenplat`) folder. Also included is a migration from App Engine `ndb` to Google Cloud NDB, mirroring the content covered in [Module 2](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-cloudndb). There is also a Python 3 version of the app in the [Module 21b](/mod21b-idenplat) folder.

NOTE: While we generally recommend using [Google Cloud client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/cloud-client-libraries) for GCP API access, we have an exception here because the [final Python 2 version](https://googleapis.dev/python/cloudresourcemanager/0.30.2) of the [Cloud Resource Manager client library](https://github.com/googleapis/python-resource-manager) (before the 2.x support was deprecated) did not have an implemented [get IAM policy](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/cloudresourcemanager/latest/google.cloud.resourcemanager_v3.services.projects.ProjectsClient#google_cloud_resourcemanager_v3_services_projects_ProjectsClient_get_iam_policy) feature, hence the need to use the [lower-level Google APIs client library](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library) to access this functionality from the API. See the [Python 3 `main.py`](/mod21b-idenplat/main.py) which uses latest Resource Manager client library.
