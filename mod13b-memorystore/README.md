# Module 13 - Migrate from App Engine `memcache` to Cloud Memorystore

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 code to a pair of different migrations related to the Module 12 and 13 codelabs. The tutorial either...

- STARTs with the _Python 3_ code in the [Module 12b repo folder](/mod12b-memcache) and leads developers through migrations from App Engine `memcache` to Cloud Memorystore and App Engine `ndb` to Cloud Datastore (skipping Cloud NDB); **or**,
- STARTs with the _Python 2_ code in the [Module 13a repo folder](/mod13a-memorystore) and leads developers through migrations from Cloud NDB to Cloud Datastore, mirroring the content covered in [Module 3](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-datastore), and also a BONUS migration from Python 2 to 3.

Either way, both set of migrations culminate in the code in this (`mod13b-memorystore`) folder.
