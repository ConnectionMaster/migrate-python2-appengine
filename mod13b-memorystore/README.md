# Module 12 - Add usage of App Engine `memcache` to Flask `ndb` sample app

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 code to the Module 12 codelab (TBD). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 1 repo folder](/mod1-flask) and leads developers through adding usage of App Engine's `memcache`, followed by a bonus migration to Python 3, culminating in the code in this folder.

> **LEGACY SERVICES PUBLIC PREVIEW**: Accessing legacy services such as App Engine `ndb` and `memcache` from Python 3 (and next generation App Engine in general) is available in a public preview. See the [Sep 2021 announcement](https://twitter.com/googledevs/status/1445916786755571712) for more information.
