# Module 12 - Add usage of App Engine `memcache` to Flask `ndb` sample app

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 code to the Module 12 codelab (TBD). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 1 repo folder](/mod1-flask) and leads developers through adding usage of App Engine's `memcache`, followed by a bonus migration to Python 3, culminating in the code in this folder.
