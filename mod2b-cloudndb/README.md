# Module 2 - Migrate from App Engine `ndb` to Cloud NDB

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 code to the [Module 2 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-cloudndb). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 1 repo folder](/mod1-flask) and leads developers through migrating away from App Engine's `ndb` to Cloud NDB to access Datastore culminating in the code in the [mod2a-cloudndb](/mod2a-cloudndb) folder. That is followed by a BONUS migration to Python 3, culminating in the code in *this* (`mod2b-cloudndb`) folder.
