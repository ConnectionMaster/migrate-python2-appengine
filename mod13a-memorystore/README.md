# Module 13 - Migrate from App Engine `memcache` to Cloud Memorystore

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 2 code to the Module 13 codelab (TBD). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 12 repo folder](/mod12-memcache) and leads developers through a migration to Cloud Memorystore, culminating in the code in this (`mod13a-memorystore`) folder. Also included is a migration from App Engine `ndb` to Google Cloud NDB, mirroring the content covered in [Module 2](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-cloudndb).
