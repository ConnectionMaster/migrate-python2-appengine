# Module 9 - Migrate from Python 2 to 3 and Cloud NDB to Cloud Datastore

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 code to the [Module 9 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-py3dstasks). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 8 repo folder](/mod7-cloudtasks) and leads developers through migrating from Python 2 to 3, Cloud NDB to Cloud Datastore (plus any changes from Cloud Tasks v1 to v2), culminating in the code in this folder.
