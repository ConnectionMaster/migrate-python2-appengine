# Module 1 - Migrate from `webapp2` to Flask

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 code to the [Module 1 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-flask). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 0 repo folder](/mod0-baseline) and leads developers through migrating away from App Engine's `webapp2` web framework to Flask, culminating in the code in the [mod1-flask](/mod1-flask) folder. The codelab does **not** currently feature any bonus migration to Python 3, however, if you do so, and add in components from the legacy services private preview program (see sidebar below), it will culminate in the code in *this* (`mod1b-flask`) folder. In the [next (Module 2) codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-cloudndb), users will migrate (the original Python 2 version of) this app from App Engine `ndb` to Cloud NDB for Datastore access.

> **LEGACY SERVICES PRIVATE PREVIEW**: Accessing a legacy service such as App Engine `ndb` from Python 3 (and next generation App Engine in general) is currently in private preview and requires access. Please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1hFLA2UFSYwIMxm9ZI3pwigORZBgjJRH0qrnhtE7nvhhRCQ/viewform) to sign-up for the program. Registering will get you in the queue to access the private preview, its documentation, and the announcements mailing list. For more info on what services are (or are not) available (at this time), see [this thread in the r/AppEngine Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/AppEngine/comments/o9wr72).
