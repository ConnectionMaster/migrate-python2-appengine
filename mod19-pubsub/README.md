# Module 19 - Migrate from App Engine `taskqueue` (pull tasks) to Cloud Pub/Sub (and Python 3)

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 2 code to the [Module 19 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-pubsub). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 18 repo folder](/mod18-gaepull) and leads developers through its migration from pull tasks via App Engine `taskqueue` to Cloud Pub/Sub and Python 3, culminating in the code in this folder. The migration from App Engine `ndb` to Cloud NDB, covered in Module 2, also takes place.

**NOTE:** While this solution Python 2 compatible, a library conflict on App Engine servers does not allow it to run properly under Python 2 on App Engine.)
