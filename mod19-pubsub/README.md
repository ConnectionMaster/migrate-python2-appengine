# Module 19 - Migrate from App Engine `taskqueue` (pull tasks) to Cloud Pub/Sub (and Python 3)

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 2 and 3 code to the [Module 19 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-pubsub). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 18 repo folder](/mod18-gaepull) and leads developers through its migration from pull tasks via App Engine `taskqueue` to Cloud Pub/Sub, culminating in the code in this folder. The code is both Python 2 and 3 compatible, and either uncomment the Python 3 runtime in `app.yaml` and delete all other lines, or just use `app3.yaml`, delete `appengine_config.py` and any `lib` folder. The migration from App Engine `ndb` to Cloud NDB, covered in Module 2, also takes place.
