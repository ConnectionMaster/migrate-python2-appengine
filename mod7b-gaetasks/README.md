# Module 7 - Add usage of App Engine `taskqueue` to Flask `ndb` sample app

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 code to the [Module 7 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-gaetasks). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 1 repo folder](/mod1-flask) and leads developers through adding usage of App Engine's `taskqueue`, culminating in the code in the [mod7-gaetasks](/mod7-gaetasks) folder. The codelab does **not** currently feature any bonus migration to Python 3, however to do so requires you to participate in the bundled services public preview program (see sidebar below) and which culminates in the code in *this* (`mod7b-gaetasks`) folder. In the [next (Module 8) codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-cloudtasks), users will migrate (the original Python 2 version of) this app from App Engine `taskqueue` to Cloud Tasks.

> **LEGACY SERVICES PUBLIC PREVIEW**: Accessing legacy services such as App Engine `ndb` and `taskqueue` from Python 3 (and next generation App Engine in general) is available in a public preview. See the [Sep 2021 announcement](https://twitter.com/googledevs/status/1445916786755571712) for more information.
