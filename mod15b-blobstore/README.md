# Module 15b - Usage of App Engine `blobstore` with Flask framework in Python 3

This repo folder is the corresponding Python 3 version of the Module 15 app.

- All files in this folder are identical to the _Python 2_ code in the [Module 15 repo folder](/mod15-blobstore) **except**:
    1. `app.yaml` was modified for the Python 3 runtime.
    1. `appengine_config.py` is unused and thus deleted.
- The _Python 3_ version of the Module 15 app ([Module 15 repo folder](/mod15-blobstore)) features the use of [Blobstore handlers classes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/services/blobstore).
