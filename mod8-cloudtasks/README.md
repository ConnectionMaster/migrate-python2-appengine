This repo folder is the corresponding Python 2 code to the [Module 8 codelab](http://g.co/codelabs/pae-migrate-cloudtasks). The tutorial STARTs with the Python 2 code in the [Module 7 repo folder](/mod7-gaetasks) and leads developers through migrating from `taskqueue` to Cloud Tasks, culminating in the code in this folder.
